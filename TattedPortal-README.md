TattedPortal is an app designed to connect clients with tattoo artists and shops. 
Clients have the capability to create a new account and log back in with their assigned client number. 
Once in the TattedPortal system, clients can create, update, or delete an appointment, as well as search the database for tattoo artists. The search allows clients to filter by tattoo style or location. 
When creating or updating an appointment, clients can choose a particular artist from the database (based on location, style expertise, or name) or have one randomly assigned if they have no preference.

Download instructions: 
clone the repository from github, bundle install and type in ruby bin/run.rb

Follow the prompts and make your appointment!
